<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great LOGIN packages available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs in LARAVEL so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a package for login with metamask so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a Login page from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one package will serve all projects since your needs may be different but what makes this package unique is the simplicity of the installation by adding just the script link to your blade as explaind below . So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this package!
